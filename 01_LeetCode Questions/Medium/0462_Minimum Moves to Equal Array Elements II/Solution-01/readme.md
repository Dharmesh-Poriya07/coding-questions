- <h3>Approach (Linear Traversal)</h3>
    <div>
    <p>
    → sort the given array in to non decreasing order and then find middle element and take absolute difference with each element of array and add it to answer.

    <h5>Time Complexity: </h5>
    <p>→ Since, we are running a loop on a 1d array of size n, hence time complexity is O(n).
    </p>
    <h5>Space Complexity:</h5>
    <p>→ We are not using any extra space, but just a few integer variables, hence O(1) auxiliary space required.
