- <h3>Question</h3>
    Implement strStr().

    Given two strings needle and haystack, return the index of the first occurrence of needle in haystack, or -1 if needle is not part of haystack.

    Clarification:

    What should we return when needle is an empty string? This is a great question to ask during an interview.

    For the purpose of this problem, we will return 0 when needle is an empty string. This is consistent to C's strstr() and Java's indexOf().

- <h3>Examples</h3>
    <div>
    <b>Example 1:</b>

    Input: haystack = "hello", needle = "ll"<br>
    Output: 2 <br>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div>
    <b>Example 2:</b>

    Input: haystack = "aaaaa", needle = "bba"<br>
    Output: -1 <br>
    </div>
    <br>
<hr>

- <h3>Constraints</h3>
    → 1 <= haystack.length, needle.length <= 10⁴

    → haystack and needle consist of only lowercase English characters. <br>
