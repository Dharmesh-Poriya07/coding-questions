- <h3>Approach (Recursive)</h3>
    <div>
    <p>
    → we needs find the minimum difference between two nodes in BST and we know that if we do inorder traversal of BST then we get sorted element.
    
    → so if we want to find minimum difference then we just needs take difference between two consecutive numbers in sorted array.
    </p>

    </div>
    <div>
    <h5>Time Complexity: </h5>
    <p>→ O(n)
    </p>
    <h5>Space Complexity:</h5>
    <p>→ O(h) where h is height of the BST.
    </p>
    </div>
